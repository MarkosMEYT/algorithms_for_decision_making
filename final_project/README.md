Parkinsonâ€™s disease is a progressive nervous system disorder that affects movement. Symptoms start gradually, sometimes starting with a barely noticeable tremor in just one hand. Tremors are common, but the disorder also commonly causes stiffness or slowing of movement. One of the symptoms is speech change: you may speak softly, quickly, slur or hesitate before talking. Your speech may be more of a monotone rather than have the usual inflections. This project uses a data of voide recordings of patients and using numeric features extracted from the audio recordings predicts if the patient has Parkinson's disease or not. Methods such as Linear Regression, Decision Trees, KNN and Boosted Trees were used to achieve very high accuracy of prediction.
