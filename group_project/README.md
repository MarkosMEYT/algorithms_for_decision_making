In this project we used the MNIST handwirten digit dataset and performed classification between digits 5 and 8. We were only limited to using 2 features, so we had to design those carefully. Accuracy of around 85% was achieved which might not seem like high however considering digit classifyers usually include multiple features the results were sufficient. We tested the features on algorithms KNN and Logistic Regression.
